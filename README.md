# Cursor Chat
A small library for digital co-existing + presence :)

As a warning, this library is for experimental purposes and should not be used in production (but very suitable for personal websites and playful experiments!).

Built on top of [yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) and [perfect-cursors](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-cursors)

For a React version of this library, check out [y-presence](https://github.com/nimeshnayaju/y-presence).
